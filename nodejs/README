This is a proof-of-concept test of a web service written in NODE.JS

The client is also written in plain NODE.JS



MyApp is a server that can deal with REST calls on URL /price 

Client/client.js is a node client that will issue a http.request with POST and
after that write some JSON data.

MyApp is configured to reset data (option "3") between runs.
